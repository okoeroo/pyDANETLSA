# pyDANETLSA
Generate TLSA record for DANE. Generated either by probing the resource and using a StartTLS or plain TLS handshake to extract the certificate, public key and formulate a TLSA 3 1 1 format. Also a X.509 in PEM or DER file format is possible.

## Class: danetlsa
### Initializer / __init__():
Start a new instance of pyDANETLSA and initialize it with the following named attributes:
* fqdn: Fully Qualified Domain Name which sets the full name of a host, e.g. smtp.koeroo.net. From this value the domain and host part is extracted. However, the algorithm expects a zone of two components, being the TLD and the zone name. If this is either three or one for gTLDs the calculation is borked. Use the ***domain*** attribute to force the calculation to become relative to the provided domain instead of guessing the zone structure.
* port: The TCP or UDP port number for with the DANE TLSA record is to be generated.
* protocol: Selects the probe method/read method. Choices are fixed to:
    10. DANETLSA_IMAP: Probes IMAP with StartTLS on the provided port.
    20. DANETLSA_POP3: Probes POP3 with StartTLS on the provided port.
    30. DANETLSA_SMTP: Probes SMTP with StartTLS on the provided port.
    40. DANETLSA_TLS: Probes with plain TLS on the provided port.
    50. DANETLSA_PEM: Reads a certificate from the ***certfile*** property. The file must be in PEM format.
    60. DANETLSA_DER: Reads a certificate from the ***certfile*** property. The file must be in DER format.
* certfile: Optional for network probe ***protocol*** selections. File path to a PEM or DER certificate to read. File must exist and must be a file (or symlink to a file).

### connect()
See ***engage()***

### engage()
This will trigger the reading of the file or start the network connection to the selected ***protocol*** to extract the certificate, transform the certificate in the right internal formats and generate the information required for a DANE TLSA record. This information can then be retried with other methods.

### subject_dn()
Returns the Subject DN in classic OpenSSL subject format.

/C=NL/ST=Zuid-Holland/L='s-Gravenhage/O=Rijksoverheid/CN=ncsc.nl
```

### process_pubkey_hex()
Internal function to process the public key hex value from the fetched certificate.
Returns the hex value

```

### pubkey_hex()
Returns the hex value of the public key.
```
78a80c6362af724f11433375890632cc099cd55a985c6e4a4a8ad741fe032f35
```

### tlsa_rdata_3_1_1()
Returns the ***3 1 1*** format value.
```
3 1 1 78a80c6362af724f11433375890632cc099cd55a985c6e4a4a8ad741fe032f35
```

### tlsa_rr_name_host()
Returns the resource record name for TLSA appropriate for the service.
```
_25._tcp.smtp
```

### tlsa_rr_name_fqdn()
Returns the resource record name as full FQDN value for TLSA appropriate for the service.
```
_25._tcp.smtp.koeroo.net.
```

### tlsa_rr()
Returns full resource record, which looks a lot like a zone file.
```
_25._tcp.smtp IN TLSA 3 1 1 78a80c6362af724f11433375890632cc099cd55a985c6e4a4a8ad741fe032f35
```

### tlsa_rr_fqdn()
Returns full resource record, which looks a lot like a zone file, the host is now an absolute name.
```
_465._tcp.smtp.koeroo.net. IN TLSA 3 1 1 78a80c6362af724f11433375890632cc099cd55a985c6e4a4a8ad741fe032f35
```


## Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import pyDANETLSA

print("Protocol support list:", pyDANETLSA.DANETLS_protocols)

d = pyDANETLSA.danetlsa(fqdn='smtp.koeroo.net.', port=25,  protocol=pyDANETLSA.DANETLSA_SMTP)
d.connect()
print("TLSA RR with FQDN", d.tlsa_rr_fqdn())
```
